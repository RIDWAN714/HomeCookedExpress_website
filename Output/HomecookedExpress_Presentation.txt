Slide 1 (Cover Page):
Title: Homecooked express
Submitted to: Md. Maherab Hasan, Lecturer, Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Submitted by: Ridwan Hossan Fahim, ID: CSE 029 077 21
Course title: Web Technology, Course Code: CSE 434
Project Title: Homecooked express
Includes a compact flowchart of the ordering flow: Home → Browse → Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order Confirmation
Uses image: frontend/public/header_img.png (placed as background/header)
Speaker notes: (Included) Brief introduction to project, aim to connect users to home-cooked meals, mention demo and deployment later.

Slide 2: Project Summary
- Purpose: Connect customers to fresh, home-cooked meals via a responsive web app.
- Key features: Browse food items; Add to cart & checkout; User authentication & order history; Image uploads for foods.
- Tech stack: React (Vite) frontend, Node/Express backend, MongoDB, Stripe payments
Speaker notes: (Included) High-level purpose, target audience, quick mention of responsive design and performance via Vite.

Slide 3: Frontend Structure
- Built with React + Vite
- Pages: Home, Cart, MyOrders, PlaceOrder, Verify
- Components: Header, Navbar, FoodDisplay, FoodItem, LoginPopup, Footer, AppDownload, ExploreMenu
- Context: Global state (cart, auth)
Speaker notes: (Included) Explain component breakdown, state management via context, and where image assets are stored (frontend/public).

Slide 4: Backend Structure
- Node.js + Express API server (port 4000)
- API endpoints: /api/food, /api/user, /api/cart, /api/order
- Static files: /images -> uploads
- Middleware: JSON parsing, CORS, JWT auth, multer for uploads
Speaker notes: (Included) Explain request lifecycle, multer usage for image uploads, and JWT verification middleware.

Slide 5: Data & External Services
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (mongoose)
- Authentication: bcrypt + JWT
- Payments: Stripe
- File uploads: multer stored under backend/uploads
Speaker notes: (Included) Talk about secure storage of secrets (env vars), connection strings, and using Atlas for remote DB.

Slide 6: System Architecture Diagram
- Block diagram: Client (Browser) ↔ Frontend (React) → Backend (Express) → MongoDB; Backend → Stripe; Backend → Uploads
- Note about HTTPS
Speaker notes: (Included) Emphasize HTTPS for Stripe and secure JWT handling; mention CORS allowed origins.

Slide 7: High-level User Flow
- Entry → Browse → Item → Cart → Checkout → Confirmation → MyOrders
Speaker notes: (Included) Walk through typical user journey and where state is persisted (localStorage/context, server DB for orders).

Slide 8: Authentication Flow
- Login & Register flows with /api/user endpoints; JWT returned and stored in context/localStorage
- Compact flowchart included
Speaker notes: (Included) Explain token lifecycle, refresh/re-login, and protected routes that check JWT onsite.

Slide 9: Ordering Flow
- Add to Cart → View Cart → Checkout → Create Stripe session → Payment Success → Create Order in DB → Confirmation
Speaker notes: (Included) Outline Stripe session creation flow, webhook vs direct confirmation approach, and order creation timing.

Slide 10: Backend Order Processing
- Validate cart, create/verify Stripe payment, create order doc (status pending/paid), save to DB
Speaker notes: (Included) Include notes on idempotency, handling webhook events, and updating order status on payment events.

Slide 11: Data Model Snapshot
- User model fields: (inferred) name, email, passwordHash, orders[], address, phone
- Food model fields: name, description, price, imagePath, category, createdAt
- Cart model fields: userId, items[{foodId, qty, price}], subtotal, createdAt
- Order model fields: userId, items, total, paymentStatus, stripeSessionId, createdAt, status
Speaker notes: (Included) Clarify relationships and indexing suggestions (e.g., index userId on orders, TTL for carts if desired).

Slide 12: Error & Edge Cases
- Payment failure handling, token expiry, image upload failure, invalid cart items
Speaker notes: (Included) Describe retry strategies, user-facing messages, validations, and logging for errors.

Slide 13: Demo, Deployment & Next Steps
- Demo plan
- Deployment checklist: env vars, HTTPS, CORS, set Stripe webhook endpoints, ensure proper file storage permissions
- Possible improvements: order search, notifications, admin dashboard, CI/CD
Speaker notes: (Included) Wrap-up and call for questions; show live demo link or steps to run locally.

Embedded images referenced where available:
- frontend/public/header_img.png (used as cover header/background)
- frontend/public/vite.svg (small icons where needed)

Design notes for recreation:
- Slide size: 16:9
- Clean readable fonts: Calibri or Arial
- Use images from repository via relative paths when rebuilding the .pptx locally
- Include speaker notes per slide
- Cover slide: compact flowchart graphic (Home → Browse → Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order Confirmation)
- Slides for Authentication Flow and Ordering Flow should include simplified flowcharts.
